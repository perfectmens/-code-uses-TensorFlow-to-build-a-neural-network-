# -code-uses-TensorFlow-to-build-a-neural-network-
This code uses TensorFlow to build a neural network with two dense layers. It trains the model on the MNIST dataset, which consists of grayscale images of handwritten digits from 0 to 9. After training, it evaluates the model's performance on the test set. Remember to install TensorFlow and its dependencies if you haven't already.
